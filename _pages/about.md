I am a PhD student at the Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Amir Houmansadr](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/) and co-advised by [Pubali Datta](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pdatta/).

I am interested in the intersection of security, privacy, network systems, cloud systems, and machine learning. This is related to the following areas: 1) Mitigating security or privacy challenges and defects of network systems in cloud settings. 2) How machine learning could support network and cloud systems using network data.

### Research Interest
* Security and Privacy on Computer Networks
* Network and Cloud Systems
* Serverless Cloud
* Machine Learning
