I am a PhD student in Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Prof. Amir Houmansadr](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/) and co-advised by [Prof. Pubali Datta](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pdatta/).

I am interested in the intersection of security, privacy, network systems, cloud systems, and machine learning. This is related to the following areas: 1) Mitigating security or privacy challenges and defects of network systems in cloud settings. 2) Identifying privacy issues of machine learning in cloud systems using network data.

### Research Interest
* Security and Privacy on Computer Networks
* Network and Cloud Systems
* Serverless Cloud
* Machine Learning
